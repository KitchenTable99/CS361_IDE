## Fixes from Project 5
* ~~add file header to SaveReason.java~~
* ~~add file header to DialogHelper.java~~
* ~~rename HighlightedCodeArea~~
  * ~~JavaCodeArea seems like a good candidate but Dale seemed to indicate even this isn't enough, so I don't know what it should be called~~
  * ~~Having CodeArea in the name indicates this is a subclass of CodeArea which it isn't~~
* Controller class does too muchâ€”break it into smaller pieces
* Handle the IOException thrown in Main.java

## Bugs that Dale found
* Running a program that contains an infinite loop of print statements prints nothing and freezes
* When compiling and running the example Scanner thing from Moodle, the print statements don't seem to work
  * The file on Dale's side also immediately crashed upon execution completion. I can't replicate that bug.
